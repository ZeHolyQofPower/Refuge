## What Am I Looking At?
Refuge is a 3D puzzle adventure game. An island to explore, jwith ournal excerpts to discover the lore, and a mysterious door that unlocks with three hidden keys. Our team of three people, [Cole](https://github.com/colelewis), [Kora](https://github.com/KoraLoud), and [I](https://github.com/ZeHolyQofPower), filled the island with realistic beaches, forests, a maze, a tower, a cabin, and various foliage.

This game also has a two minute [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IcB0dZ5vS0&t=10s) on YouTube.
